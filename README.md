# The Holy Bible: Revised American Standard Version

Edited by: William Masopust

Revision: 2025β

The Revised American Standard Version is a derivative work of the 1901 American Standard Version of the Bible. This is a sister revision project to the Revised Common Version (http://www.revisedcommonversion.com), which is based on the text of Noah Webster's Common Version (a revision of the King James Version).

The Revised Version, Standard American Edition of the Bible, more commonly known as the American Standard Version (ASV), is a version of the Bible that was completed in 1901. It was originally best known by its full name, but soon came to have other names, such as the American Revised Version, the American Standard Revision, the American Standard Revised Bible, and the American Standard Edition. By the time its copyright was renewed in 1929, it had come to be known by its present name, the American Standard Version. Because of its prominence in seminaries, it was in America sometimes simply called the Standard Bible.

The Revised American Standard Version (RASV) is not yet a full modernization of the ASV text. For now, I am preserving the older English style found in the ASV.

## Initial Revisions

This work initially underwent six modifications:
1. All instances of _Jehovah_ have been changed to _Yahweh_;
2. All instances of _unto_ have been changed to _to_ or a better equivalent.
3. The modern word for donkey is used throughout the text.
4. The updating of words to American spellings or equivalents.
5. The persons speaking have been added in the text of Song of Solomon.
6. The titles of the books have been modified to match the titles in the Revised Common Version.

The goal going forward is to update punctuation and word order, mark the end of paragraphs, mark lines of poetry, and modernize select archaic words, preserving the style of the text. I may also add words for implied meaning in square brackets. Long term, I may add quotation marks and format the text in paragraph form in either Markdown or plain text format. All changes will be documented in the commits of this repository.
